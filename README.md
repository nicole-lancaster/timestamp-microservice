# Timestamp Microservice

A simple timestamp microservice, live version is hosted on replit here: https://replit.com/@nicole-lancaste/timestamp-microservice

## Description

This is a timestamp microservice built as part of the freeCodeCamp backend and API certification https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/ (project 1 of 5)

freeCodeCamp give you a boilerplate project template that you can clone here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-timestamp/ however I chose to build my own project from scratch.
